# NgSharedLibs

The are my shared angular libraries.  As build more, and extract more from my other projects I'll add them here.


## Projects
### ng-app-help
NgAppHelp is simple angular 2+ library the provides a great way to provide your users in-app help.  The user experience is to provide help button that when pressed, highlights all elements that have attached help.  The user can then hover over those 'help enabled' elements and see detailed help as a modal.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
